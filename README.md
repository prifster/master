Notes
Actual  force  is  directly  proportional  to    F.K.force =  [force  coefficient]  x  Froude-Krylov force
 
Estimation  of  Froude-Krylov force
Let  p  =  normal  instantaneous  pressure  (given  say  by  a  wave  theory)  acting  on ‘ds’  (elemental  submerged  area). 
n x and  n z =  x  and  z  components  of  unit vector  normal  to  ds  respectively.
S    =   total  submerged  area
